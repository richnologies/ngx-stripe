    <p>
      Ngx Stripe is just a wrapper around the StripeJS functionality. The scope of the library is to ease collecting
      payment information within an Angular Application, but in order to perform most of the operations you will need
      back-end code. Please check this example to collect a payment with Payment Intents.

    <p>
      The whole purpose of StripeJS is to be able to collect Payment information keeping your site compliant with
      industry regulation without too much burden. In order to do that, information is collected inside an iFrame. We need
      a way to perform validation without accessing plain values. Please check the examples page to see how it can be done.
