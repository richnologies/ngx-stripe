    <p>
      Ngx Stripe is just a wrapper around the StripeJS functionality.
      The scope of the library is to ease collecting payment information
      within an Angular Application, but in order to perform most of the
      operations you will need back-end code. Please check this example
      to collect a payment with Payment Intents.

    <p>
      The whole purpose of StripeJS is to be able to collect Payment
      information keeping your site compliant with industry regulation
      without too much burden. In order to do that, information
      is collect inside an iFrame. We need a way to perform validation
      without accessing plain values. Please check this example to see how can be done.
