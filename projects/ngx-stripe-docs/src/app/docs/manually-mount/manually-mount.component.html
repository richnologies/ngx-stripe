      In some scenarios you may want to fully control the style, the loading flow or simply the provided Element
      Components don't suit well for your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those cases you manually mount the Stripe Element on any DOM element. In the example bellow, we are mounting a
      Card Element into the div with id
      <strong>card-element</strong>. We need to do 3 things the Card Component usually do for us:
    </p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>Fetch the Elements Object</li>
      <li>
        Create the Stripe Element. In this example, a card element is used, but the same approach can be applied to any other supported payment method.
      </li>
      <li>Mount the element into the DOM</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By doing the steps above, we gain direct access to the Stripe Element.</p>
    <ngstr-panel type="warning"> This is a more flexible approach, but also a little bit more involving </ngstr-panel>
